	Attributes
	----------
	_board: list(list)
		Represent the board with a 2d array _board[x][y]
		where open spaces are 0 and closed spaces are 1
		and a coordinate system where [0][0] is the top-
		left corner, and x increases to the right while
		y increases going down (this is an arbitrary
		convention choice -- there are many other options
		that are just as good)

	_parity: bool
		Keep track of active player initiative (which
		player has control to move) where 0 indicates that
		player one has initiative and 1 indicates player two

	_player_locations: list(tuple)
		Keep track of the current location of each player
		on the board where position is encoded by the
		board indices of their last move, e.g., [(0, 0), (1, 0)]
		means player one is at (0, 0) and player two is at (1, 0)
